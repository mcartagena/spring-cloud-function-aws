# spring-cloud-function-aws
My first spring cloud function in AWS lambda.

## Issue

I can't define a monolithic lambda function. I can't define two spring cloud beans in one project. By definition I should define only one bean for one lambda function.

## Reference

I have followed a nice tutorial for this approach [How to Deploy a Spring Cloud Function on AWS Lambda](https://mydeveloperplanet.com/2020/11/04/how-to-deploy-a-spring-cloud-function-on-aws-lambda/)
